## Introduction
Codelearn is online application which can help you learn to code. After registration you'll have access to LearnGround and PlayGround. Former contains different lectures and excercises about programming topics, later is here for you just to play with code and test it in your browser. In PlayGround you can save your projects and then share them or just load them later and do some changes. LearnGround saves your progress and code you wrote as an excercise for every lecture, so you can change or just check it later.

## Languages we teach
- HTML (in progress)
- CSS (in progress)
- Javascript (in progress)

## Note
To HTML editor lives inside of `<body>` tag, so it's better to avoid using `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>` and `<head>` elements.

## BUG
- there is no way to save project which already exists (working on fix)

## LearnGround
Learn Ground is place where you'll learn to code. It consists of 3 parts and you can change width of left and right size by dragging handle bar.
