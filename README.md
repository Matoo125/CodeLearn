## Introduction
Codelearn is online application which can help you learn to code. After registration you'll have access to LearnGround and PlayGround. Former contains different lectures and excercises about programming topics, later is here for you just to play with code and test it in your browser. In PlayGround you can save your projects and then share them or just load them later and do some changes. LearnGround saves your progress and code you wrote as an excercise for every lecture, so you can change or just check it later.

## Languages we teach

## Note
To HTML editor lives inside of `<body>` tag, so it's better to avoid using `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>` and `<head>` elements.

## BUG

## LearnGround
Learn Ground is place where you'll learn to code. It consists of 3 parts and you can change width of left and right size by dragging handle bar.
#### Left Side
On the left side you have 3 tabs for writting HTML, CSS and Javascript
#### Right Side
On the right side you have 3 tabs 
*prepare* - Theoretical part of lesson
*exercise* - Practical part of lesson with hidden solution
*see* - Rendered result of your code
#### Navbar
All the important buttons have their place in navbar
*Lessons* - opens the sidebar with list of lessons
*Completed* - marks your lesson as completed
*Incomplete* - if you marked the lesson as completed, but you find out, it is not.
*Run* - runs your code, changes right side tab to 'see', saves your code.
*Logout* - destroys your current session

## PlayGround
It is place to try the things you learn, or just try whatever is on your mind and practise. You can save your code if you made something worth it.

#### Left Side
In contrast to Learn Ground, there are no tabs, but 3 areas above each other for HTML, CSS and JS which you can resize as you wish.
#### Right Side
There is your result page
